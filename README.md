## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/profLewis/librat/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/profLewis/librat.git`

`librat` (actually called `ratlib` in the code ) is a ray tracing library built for radiative transfer simulations for remote sensing studies. It was originally written in the later 1980s/early 1990s by [P. Lewis](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/), as part of his [PhD, A Botanical Plant Modelling System for Remote Sensing
Simulation Studies, UCL, 1996](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/phd). The main advantage of this code is that it is part of a community reference effort for radiative transfer. That has been a major motivating factor in releasing the code in this (easy to use) form. It has also been used in a [wide range of studies](docs/ratindex.md).

Read the [Getting started page](https://github.com/profLewis/librat/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for information on examples, and more.
