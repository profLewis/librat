In that case, we need a set of *base* descriptors for these different types of file.\n",

Being familiar with these tools takes somne time of course, so you might now want to go on and take [some other unix/linux course](https://www.unixtutorial.org/basic-unix-commands) to see if you can deepen your understanding in that way. Alternatively, just spend some time exploring your system, looking to see what files are where, reading on the internet or help pages what they do, and so on.\n",
