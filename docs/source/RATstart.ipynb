This is a short piece of `C` code, the main role of with is to present a set of simple functions controlled by text input on the command line. One of these 'options' (option 14) gives an extremely fexible interface for defining viewing and illumination conditions for radiative transfer simulations, and it is this part of the interface that is most widely used. \n",
